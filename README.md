This .pdf contains stories, sayings, riddles, and the lyrics of songs collected in the village of Sambande starting in July 2021. The storytellers are anonymous here because of data collection restrictions. The project was designed by Bill Dyer with supervision from Dr. Fiona McLaughlin and approved by the University of Florida IRB. The stories represent the culture of the Saloum region of central Senegal and the Saloum dialect of the Sereer and Wolof languages. Thank you to the village chief Mamadou Diouf, Mr. Ngor Mbodj, and Mr. Malick Diouf, and all storytellers and participants. Jokonjal. Jërëgenjëf.
